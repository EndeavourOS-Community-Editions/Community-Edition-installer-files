## How to get my Community Edition added into EndeavourOS installer?

In the install-process you can select a single C_E for the selection window an image  
and a short description of your edition is required.  
In order to install the necessary packages,  
 
you need a package list and ultimately the necessary configuration files (DotFiles)  
and scripts that are needed to start and set up the interface.
