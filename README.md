## How to get my Community Edition added into EndeavourOS installer?

In the install-process you can select a single Community Edition.  
For the selection window an image and a short description of your edition is required.  
In order to install the necessary packages,  
you need a package list and ultimately the necessary configuration files (DotFiles)  
and scripts that are needed to start and set up the interface.
